# Portfolio-App :

I am creating this web page for try out learning React Componets and props. Here I just wanted to understand how props work and how to create a React single page application by creating components... So I created this page. However, this is not responsive for every devices because i don't focus on styling ..

### Case study :

Here I'm facing a lot of things or code are using repetitive. So, that I make a decision how to broke this things into small to small components that make me feel more readable this code or components.I'm Creating here a lot of Components...Now some of i'm describing here:

- Button-Component: I'm using a single button for single pages but when I see this same type of button need for multiple time and using this button multiple page, then I created a component which buttons. Here I'm Creating this button with a two type of variants one of is just like normal button , which is button.jsx and second is arrowbutton.jsx for adding an icon with the button.

- Navabar-Component: I see the heading section and the footer section need navbar which is like just same.And I creating a navbar component which is ListItem.jsx. It's basically a single listItem element of component where I'm using props for learning this props. And now , it's works for header-navbar.jsx and footer-navbar.jsx

- SocialLinks-Component: I create here social links components , which are very useful for using multiple time with multiple pages.I see I need social links over the page here and there so I decide to make it a component and using this multiple times.
